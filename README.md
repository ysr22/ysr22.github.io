## My Plans
- Understand the **principles** of major bioinformatical methods (Listen carefully in class!)
- Learn to **manipulate** data myself. (Do HW in time!)
- **Read relative research papers** every day/week to grasp the application context of each method.
- Try do some analysis with data **in our lab**.
- I'm simultaneously taking a statistical learning (discussing about ML) course, expecting to deep further into **ML-related analysis** as well!
