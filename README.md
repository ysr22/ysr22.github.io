## Lec 1. Decode the Language of Life (2024-3-1)

### 1 Gene: Coding & Noncoding
#### 1.1 Gene and Genome
- **Gene**: A piece of Information. â†’ **Genome**: Combination of genes.
#### 1.2 Why do humans have so few genes? (*Science* 125 Questions)
- Human: ~21,000 genes, fewer than many other organisms.  
- **Noncoding genes** percentage: HIGH!! (nearly 100%) 
- Different types of RNAs  
  mRNA  
  **ncRNAs**: canonical (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, srpRNA, ...) ; small (miRNA, piRNA, siRNA) ; long (MALAT1, HOTAIR,...)

### 2 Method: Sequencing & Computing
#### 2.1 Revolution of Sequencing Technologies
- Sanger, High Throughput, Nanopore, Single Molecule Real-time ...
#### 2.2 Big and High Dimensional Data
#### 2.3 3 Steps of Bioinformatics
- **Information**: Medical/Biological data
- **Model**: Mathematical/Probability model - How you **view** your data, What kind of **relations/correlations** you're curious about
- **Algorithm**: Computational Algorithm - How you **calculate to fit** your data into the selected model **efficiently**

## My Plans
- Understand the **principles** of major bioinformatical methods (Listen carefully in class!)
- Learn to **manipulate** data myself. (Do HW in time!)
- **Read relative research papers** every day/week to grasp the application context of each method.
- Do some analysis with data **in our lab**.
- I'm simultaneously taking a statistical learning (discussing about ML) course, expecting to deep further into **ML-related analysis** as well!
- Continue learning and practicing bioinformatics skills **after the end of this course**!!
